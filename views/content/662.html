Definitions</b></p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(1) </b>In this Part, the term,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) "limit states" means those conditions of a <i>building </i>structure that result in the <i>building</i> ceasing to fulfill the function for which it was designed. (Those limit states concerning safety are called ultimate limit states (ULS) and include exceeding the load-carrying capacity, overturning, sliding and fracture; those limit states that restrict the intended use and <i>occupancy</i> of the <i>building</i> are called serviceability limit states (SLS) and include deflection, vibration, permanent deformation and local structural damage such as cracking; and those limit states that represent failure under repeated loading are called fatigue limit states),</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) "specified loads (<b>C, D, E, H, L, P, S, T</b> and <b>W</b>)" mean those loads set out in Table <a href="/content/660" title="Loads and Effects">4.1.2.1.</a>A.,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (c) "principal load" means the specified variable load or rare load that dominates in a given load combination,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (d) "companion load" means a specified variable load that accompanies the principal load in a given load combination,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (e) "service load" means a specified load used for the evaluation of a serviceability limit state,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (f) "principal-load factor" means a factor applied to the principal load in a load combination to account for the variability of the load and load pattern and the analysis of its effects,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (g) "companion-load factor" means a factor that, when applied to a companion load in the load combination, gives the probable magnitude of a companion load acting simultaneously with the factored principal load,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (h) "importance factor, I," means a factor applied in Subsections 4.1.6. to 4.1.8. to obtain the specified load and take into account the consequences of failure as related to the limit state and the use and <i>occupancy</i> of the <i>building</i>,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (i) "factored load" means the product of a specified load and its principal-load factor or companion-load factor,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (j) "effects" refers to forces, moments, deformations or vibrations that occur in the structure,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (k) "nominal resistance, R," of a member, connection or structure, is based on the geometry and on the specified properties of the structural materials,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (l) "resistance factor, Φ," means a factor applied to a specified material property or to the resistance of a member, connection or structure, and that, for the limit state under consideration, takes into account the variability of dimensions and material properties, workmanship, type of failure and uncertainty in the prediction of resistance, and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (m) "factored resistance, ΦR," means the product of nominal resistance and the applicable resistance factor.</p>
