Combustible insulationinsulation and its Protection</b></p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (1) </b><i>Combustible</i>insulationinsulation, other than foamed plastics, is permitted in a

plastic is protected on both sides by sheet steel not less than 0.38 mm thick that will remain in place for not less than 10 min when the wall panel is tested in conformance with CAN/ULC-S101, "Fire
