Heat Recovery ventilators</b></p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(1) </b>Where a heat recovery ventilator is installed to provide all or part of the requirements of this Subsection, this Article shall apply.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(2) </b>Heat recovery ventilators shall be designed to provide a minimum 55% sensible heat recovery efficiency when tested to the low temperature thermal and ventilation performance test method set out in CAN/CSA-C439, "Rating the Performance of Heat/Energy-Recovery ventilators", at a Station 1 test temperature of –25°C at an air flow not less than 30 L/s.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(3) </b>Where a heat recovery ventilator is connected to a forced air heating system, the supply side of the ventilator shall be directly connected to the return air side of the forced air heating system.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(4) </b>Two or more heat recovery ventilators shall not be connected in parallel air flow to a common air <i>supply duct</i> unless specifically recommended by the manufacturer.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(5) </b>Two or more heat recovery ventilators shall not be connected in parallel air flow to a common downstream <i>exhaust duct</i>.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(6) </b>Heat recovery ventilators installed in unheated spaces shall be installed so as to avoid condensation of moisture on fans and motors in exhaust air, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(7) </b>All start-up procedures recommended by the manufacturer including air balancing and air-flow determination shall be followed.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(8) </b>Free flow of condensate shall be provided in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations or, in their absence, a condensate drain of minimum ½ inch nominal pipe size pitched in the direction of flow and complete with a trap or condensate pump with sufficient capacity shall be installed.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(9) </b>The heat recovery ventilator and all condensate lines shall be installed in a space where the ambient temperature will not adversely affect the operation of the system.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(10) </b>When operating at the rate required in Article <a href="/content/2146" title="Principal Exhaust">9.32.3.4.</a>, the supply and exhaust airflow rates of the heat recovery ventilator shall be balanced so that the value of the lesser flow shall be at least 90% of the value of the greater flow, unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer.</p>
