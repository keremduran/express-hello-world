prevent passage of odours from one system to another when the fan is not in operation, or</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) the <i>exhaust ducts</i> discharge to a shaft that is served by an exhaust fan having a capacity that is equal to or greater than the combined capacity of the exhaust fans discharging to the <i>plenum </i>multiplied by the operation diversity factor, provided that the exhaust fan serving the shaft operates continuously.</p> <p class="subsection-e">  <b>(11) </b>Where <i>exhaust ducts</i> containing air from <i>conditioned spaces</i> pass through or are adjacent to
