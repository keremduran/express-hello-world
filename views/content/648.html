</p><p class="section-e"><b>3.16.1.7. Exits and Means of Egress</b></p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (1) </b>Except as permitted in Sentences (2) and (3), every walkway or platform level shall be provided with no fewer than two <i>exits</i>conforming to Section 3.4.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (2) </b>An <i>access to exit </i>from an elevated platform level may be provided by means of open unenclosed stairs serving,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) not more than four platform levels, the highest of which shall be not more than 12 m above the main floor, where the <i>shelf and rack storage system </i>is intended for the storage of Class I, II, III and IV commodities, as defined in nfpa 13, "installation of Sprinkler Systems", and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) not more than two platform levels, where the <i>shelf and

</b>Any single platform or walkway in a <i>shelf and rack storage system </i>may be served by a single unenclosed stair leading to the platform or walkway level immediately below provided,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) the platform or walkway does not exceed 200 m<sup>2</sup> in area,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) the travel distance on the platform or walkway to the level below, including the travel distance along the single unenclosed egress stair, does not exceed 25 m, and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (c) the platform or walkway below is provided with two separate egress stairs or <i>exits</i>.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (4) </b>The maximum travel distance on an elevated platform to the ground floor level, including the travel distance along unenclosed stairs, shall not exceed 45 m.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (5) </b>The maximum travel distance on an elevated platform to an <i>exit</i> serving that platform shall not exceed 45 m.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>

</i>shall be designed on the basis of a time-based egress analysis using the following criteria:</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (i) occupant egress speed of 1 m/sec shall be used for horizontal egress routes within the <i>shelf and rack storage system</i>,</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (ii) occupant egress speed of 0.6 m/sec shall be used for vertical egress routes within the <i>shelf and rack storage system</i>, measured on the diagonal along the nosing of the stairs,</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (iii) occupant egress speed of 1.3 m/sec shall be used for horizontal egress routes along a main aisle on the ground floor level,</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (iv) each lift-gate shall be accorded an egress time of 10 seconds,</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (v) each at-level conveyor

number of at-level cross overs in the <i>means of egress</i>,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (c) the total egress time from any point in the <i>shelf and rack storage system</i> shall be a maximum of 4 minutes,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (d) a fire alarm and detection system conforming to Subsection 3.2.4. shall be installed in the <i>building</i>,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (e)<i>  smoke detectors</i> shall be provided under all solid decking and walkways,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (f) clearly identified and easily accessible pull stations shall be provided at egress stairs, conveyor cross-overs or lift-gates located along egress paths, and</p> <p class="clause-e">  (g) the <i>occupant load</i> on each level of the <i>shelf and rack storage system</i> shall not exceed 10 persons

</b>Where <i>exits </i>are provided to comply with Sentence <a href="/content/400" title="Location of Exits">3.4.2.5.</a>(2), main aisles serving the <i>shelf and rack storage system </i>on the ground floor, leading from egress stairs directly to an <i>exit</i>, shall be clearly demarcated and have a minimum unobstructed, clear-aisle width of 2.4 m.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (12) </b>Where a lift-gate is incorporated along an egress route,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) a maximum of two lift-gates may be within a single egress route,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (b) each lift-gate shall be

cross-over,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (c) flat, metal inserts shall be placed between each roller over the required egress width at each at-level conveyor cross-over to provide a walking surface,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (d) at least two inserts not less than 100 mm wide shall be arranged symmetrically between the handrails serving the at-level cross-over,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (e) inserts
